## D-001 - Precision: `solveScalar` cannot be float while `scalar` is double

**Status:** open - recommendation below, user confirmation requested (2026-09-21).

**Finding.** Spec 3 requires `WM_PRECISION_OPTION=SPDP` and a Phase 0 check
`sizeof(Foam::solveScalar)==4 && sizeof(Foam::scalar)==8`. In OpenFOAM v2606
(`src/OpenFOAM/primitives/Scalar/scalar/scalarFwd.H`):

    #if defined(WM_SP)      scalar=float   solveScalar=float
    #elif defined(WM_SPDP)  scalar=float   solveScalar=double
    #elif defined(WM_DP)    scalar=double  solveScalar=double

No build option satisfies the literal criterion. SPDP is the inverse of the
spec's intent (fields in float, linear solve in double). Measured on the
installed system build: `linux64GccDPInt32Opt`, `sizeof(scalar)=8`,
`sizeof(solveScalar)=8`.

**Decision (recommended).** Keep OpenFOAM in DP. The library defines its own
storage types in `src/blockMatrix/blockScalar.H`:
`blockScalar = floatScalar` (block coefficients, Krylov/AMG vectors) and
`reduceScalar = doubleScalar` (all accumulations, MPI reductions). Where the
spec says `solveScalar` for block data, the implementation uses
`blockScalar`. Native `solveScalar` is never used for block data.
Phase 0 gate evaluates `sizeof(blockScalar)==4 && sizeof(scalar)==8` and
also records the literal `sizeof(solveScalar)` with a reference to this entry.

**Impact.** Spec intent is met exactly; the native `simpleFoam` reference runs
with the same double-precision fields as `coupledFoam` (spec 3, "identical
precision"). No SPDP build is made.

## D-002 - Section 5.5 boundary-condition table is truncated in the spec

**Status:** decided.

**Finding.** The table was authored in Markdown with `|S_f|` inside cells; the
pipes split the cells. Lost content: the continuity-row entry of
fixedValue-U/zeroGradient-p, the wall diffusion coefficient, the p-p outlet
entry, the slip continuity entry and the totalPressure formula tail.

**Decision.** All BCs are made implicit in one uniform way, using the native
linearisation that every OpenFOAM patch field already provides:
`U_f = valueInternalCoeffs(w) . U_P + valueBoundaryCoeffs(w)` (componentwise)
and the same for `p`. Hence:

| Patch (U / p) | momentum rows | continuity row |
|---|---|---|
| fixedValue / zeroGradient | native `fvm::div` upwind + `fvm::laplacian` internal/boundary coeffs (wall: `a_P += nu_eff |S_f| deltaCoeff`, `b_P += nu_eff |S_f| deltaCoeff U_b`); pressure: `+S_f` on column 3 of the diag block (`p_f=p_P`) | `b^(3) -= U_b . S_f`; no p-p term (`D_f=0`, see D-013) |
| zeroGradient / fixedValue (outlet) | convection `a_P += phi_f`; pressure `b_P -= S_f p_b`; no diffusion | `+S_f^T` on U columns; p-p: `a^(3,3) += D_f |S_f| deltaCoeff`, `b^(3) += D_f |S_f| deltaCoeff p_b` (sign consistent with the `-laplacian` form, D-003) |
| slip / symmetry | native basicSymmetry coefficients (normal component removed) | `U_f . S_f = 0` -> no contribution |
| inletOutlet / totalPressure | native mixed coefficients (valueFraction from sign of phi_f); totalPressure `p_b = p0 - 1/2 |U_P|^2` lagged by one outer iteration | as above per face |
| cyclic / cyclicAMI | explicit-coupled: neighbour values lagged (source) | same |
| processor | implicit via block interface coefficients | same |

**Impact.** No BC is dropped. inletOutlet/totalPressure use native patch
evaluation, so any BC derived from fixedValue/zeroGradient/mixed works.

## D-003 - Section 5.3(d): dimension and sign of the p-p block

**Finding.** 5.3(d) writes the coefficient as `-D_f |S_f|^2 / |d_f . n_f|`;
5.3(e) uses `|S_f| / |d_f . n_f|`. Only the latter is dimensionally
consistent with the flux (m^3/s). The outlet cell of 5.5 reads
`a^(3,3) -= D_f ...`, which contradicts an M-matrix with negative
off-diagonals.

**Decision.** p-p off-diagonal `-D_f |S_f| deltaCoeff_f`
(`deltaCoeff_f = 1/|d_f . n_f|`, native `nonOrthDeltaCoeffs`), diagonal the
negative row sum plus the fixed-p boundary term `+D_f |S_f| deltaCoeff_f`.
Row 3 is the discrete `sum_f phi_f = 0`, so matrix and flux update (5.3e) are
built in the same face loop.

## D-004 - Test-doubleReduce reference value

**Finding.** 6.4 asks for "sum of 10^8 values of 1e-4 in float ... double result
must equal 1e4 to 1e-9 relative". `1e-4` is not representable in float:
`float(1e-4) = 9.99999974737875e-05`, so the exact sum of 10^8 such floats is
`9999.99974737875`, 2.5e-8 away from 1e4. The literal criterion fails for a
perfect accumulator.

**Decision.** The test checks the accumulator, not the representation: the
double-accumulated sum must equal `1e8 * double(float(1e-4))` to 1e-9 relative
(threshold unchanged). It also reports the difference to 1e4 and the float
result (expected wrong by >1 %, documenting the rule).

## D-005 - Section 12.3: "stop when both: (i) ... or (ii) ..."

**Decision.** Keyword `convergence.mode` (default `any`): the solver stops when
(i) `R_n < residualTol`, or, if a forceCoeffs function object is present,
when (ii) holds. `mode all` requires both. The benchmark harness evaluates (ii)
itself with the solvers' internal criteria disabled (spec 14), so the default
does not affect benchmark numbers.

## D-006 - MRF: `Omega x U`, not `2 Omega x U`

**Finding.** 5.6 says "Coriolis term 2 Omega x U ... relative frame formulation
as native MRF.DDt". Native MRF (`MRFZone::addCoriolis`) solves for the absolute
velocity and adds `Omega x U_abs`, which equals the relative-frame
`2 Omega x U_r + Omega x (Omega x r)`. The solver's `U` is absolute (native
fields and BCs, `MRF.correctBoundaryVelocity`), so `2 Omega x U` would be wrong
by a factor.

**Decision.** Implicit `V_P [Omega]_x` on the 3x3 momentum diagonal block,
i.e. exactly native `MRF.DDt` made implicit. Omega per cell is extracted from
the native `MRFZoneList::DDt` applied to the three unit vectors (public API
only; handles several zones and time-dependent Omega).

## D-007 - Hardware deviations

- WSL sees 94 GB RAM, spec assumes 128 GB. The 45 M-cell run (Phase 2) budget
  of 100-115 GB cannot be verified on this machine.
- SMT is on (32 logical / 16 physical cores). All MPI runs use
  `mpirun --bind-to core --map-by core`.
- The machine is shared with other long jobs; builds use `nice -n 19` and
  `WM_NCOMPPROCS=8`, which lengthens build time but not measured solver times.
  Benchmarks are only run when no other solver is running (checked and
  recorded in each benchmark JSON: `loadavg_before`).

## D-008 - Constants that the spec states but Section 11 does not list

Rule 0.5 forbids magic numbers; Section 11 is "complete" but several numbers
appear elsewhere. They become dictionary entries with the spec value as
default, under `coupled.guards` / `coupled.linear`:
`pivotGuard 1e-30` (6.3), `clampValue 1e30` (9.2), `maxRestarts 3` (6.2),
`maxCopAttempts 3` (6.3), `sentinel.UFactor 10`, `sentinel.pFactor 50`,
`sentinel.cflFactor 0.25` (9.3), `sentinel.maxReport 20`,
`remediation.warnFraction 0.01`, `remediation.warnInterval 100` (8.2),
`convergence.startupSwitchR 1e-2` (7.4), `nutMaxFactor` (9.2, listed).
The defaults are printed with the effective settings (11).

## D-009 - MRF has no gating test

**Finding.** Phase D implements implicit MRF, but no test case T0-T5 contains
an MRF zone, so the feature is not verified by any gate.

**Decision.** Add informational test `T-mrf` on the
`simpleFoam/mixerVessel2D` tutorial (MRF, SST): coupledFoam vs simpleFoam,
torque on the rotor within 2 %. Informational only (not a gate), because the
spec defines no threshold; the result is reported.

## D-010 - Build directory names

`~/OF/OpenFOAM-v2606-DP-Opt` and `~/OF/OpenFOAM-v2606-DP-Debug` instead of the
spec's `OpenFOAM-v2606-Opt/-Debug`: the precision is part of the name so a
DP and an SP/SPDP tree can never be confused.

## D-011 - Source file extensions

The spec's layout uses `.C/.H`; v2606 itself moved to `.cxx/.txx`. The project
keeps `.C/.H` as specified; wmake handles both.

## D-012 - Residual `b - A x` in double

The increment form (5.7) only helps if the right-hand side `b - A x` is exact.
It is evaluated in double from the double-precision assembly, before the
coefficients are narrowed to `blockScalar` (5.2 "conversion happens once per
outer iteration at store time"). The float matrix is only used for the
increment solve. This is what allows `R < 1e-8` (T0) with a float solver.

## D-013 - Rhie-Chow on boundaries

`D_f = 0` on boundary faces where p is not fixed (zeroGradient walls/inlets),
otherwise the "average gradient" term would create a spurious flux through
walls. On fixed-p faces `D_f = D_P` and the gradient term uses the cell
gradient. Coupled faces use the interpolated `D_f`.

## D-014 - Momentum diffusion assembled by the solver, not `divDevSigma`

`turbulence->divDevSigma(U)` would take the non-orthogonal correction limiter
from `fvSchemes`, which cannot vary per cell. To honour `nonOrthLimiter` (5.3a)
and `remediation.static.nonOrthLimiter` (8.1), the assembler builds
`-fvm::laplacian(nuEff, U)` with the uncorrected scheme plus an explicit
per-face-limited correction (native `limitedSnGrad` correction, the stronger
limit on faces touching a static cell), plus the explicit transpose term
`-fvc::div(nuEff dev2(T(grad U)))` exactly as native `linearViscousStress`.
The same limiter treatment is applied to the p-p Laplacian.
